# SchoolDatabase_Fullstack

This is the client part of a school-database project. The server-side API (including the sqlite database) can be found in my github.com/TheRealSvc/treehouse_9_api repository.
The App can be found in the /client folder.  The other folders are a reference on how it should look and feel.
